# Changelog

All notable changes to the Asterisk AI Voice Agent project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned

- Additional provider integrations
- Enhanced monitoring features

## [6.3.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Microsoft Azure Speech Service STT & TTS**: Full modular pipeline support with three adapters — `AzureSTTFastAdapter` (REST batch transcription), `AzureSTTRealtimeAdapter` (WebSocket streaming with VAD), and `AzureTTSAdapter` (SSML synthesis with streaming and non-streaming modes). Includes Admin UI forms, quick-add templates, security key injection, A-law/μ-law passthrough, and validated config in `ai-agent.yaml`. Contributed by [@egorky](https://github.com/egorky).
- **MiniMax LLM Pipeline Adapter**: New LLM provider supporting MiniMax M2.7 models (latest flagship with enhanced reasoning and coding) via OpenAI-compatible API. Includes tool-calling support, Admin UI integration, and full test suite. Contributed by [@octo-patch](https://github.com/octo-patch).
- **Call Recording Playback**: Play back Asterisk/FreePBX call recordings directly from the Call Details modal in the Admin UI. Recordings are auto-matched by channel unique ID from the monitor directory (`YYYY/MM/DD/` layout). Includes play/pause controls, seek bar, time display, filename, and file size. Empty WAV files (header-only) are shown as "no audio captured". Configurable via `ASTERISK_RECORDING_PATH` env var.
- **Google Calendar delete()**: Full delete event implementation with timezone handling fixes and code quality improvements. Contributed by [@gcsuri](https://github.com/gcsuri).

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Realtime farewell timeout**: Cancel farewell timeout before emitting HangupReady to prevent race condition on call termination.
- **Greeting protection duration**: Increased to 5000ms for more reliable greeting playback on slower connections.
- **Local AI setup wizard**: Show "Setting Up Local AI Server" until server is actually ready; improved build log filtering for progress tracking.
- **NVIDIA GPU setup**: Auto-install nvidia-container-toolkit and improved wizard progress tracking.

### Security

- **Azure SSRF prevention**: Shared `validate_azure_region()` regex validator applied across Pydantic config models, runtime URL builders, and admin API endpoint.
- **PII logging discipline**: Removed transcript/text preview strings from all log statements across engine, Azure, and OpenAI adapters — logs now contain metadata only (length, role, flags).
- **Azure key injection**: Type-based detection (`cfg_type == "azure"`) for custom-named Azure providers, not just name-prefix matching.
- **Input validation hardening**: LLM aggregation thresholds clamped with try/except and min=1 guards in both Python backend and React frontend.

### Improved

- **Azure STT bounded pre-speech buffer**: Audio buffer only accumulates when speech is detected or speaking is active, preventing unbounded memory growth during long silences.
- **Azure VAD timeout propagation**: `vad_silence_timeout_ms` and `vad_initial_silence_timeout_ms` now properly passed through `_compose_options`.
- **Azure variant validation**: Constrained to `Literal["realtime", "fast"]` across config model, orchestrator, and Admin UI (select dropdown instead of free text).
- **PEP 563 deferred annotations**: `from __future__ import annotations` in azure.py enables safe optional-dependency type hints when aiohttp is not installed.

## [6.3.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **CLI verification tooling**: `agent check --local/--remote` for Local AI Server + Asterisk/Admin UI validation; `agent rca --local` for automated local test report generation and Community Test Matrix submissions.
- **Community Test Matrix**: Added `docs/COMMUNITY_TEST_MATRIX.md` and a GitHub issue template for standardized local AI test result reporting.
- **Admin UI backend enable/rebuild flow**: One-click backend enable with progress tracking for optional Local AI Server backends (e.g., Faster-Whisper, Whisper.cpp, MeloTTS).
- **Local AI Server WS protocol contract**: JSON-schema-based protocol contract + smoke test utilities to stabilize client/server evolution.

### Improved

- **CPU-first onboarding**: Local AI Server defaults to `runtime_mode=minimal` when preflight reports no GPU (`GPU_AVAILABLE=false`) so CPU-only systems start reliably without LLM model files.
- **GPU ergonomics**: GPU layer auto-detection for `LOCAL_LLM_GPU_LAYERS=-1`, preflight warnings for GPU-detected-but-CPU-configured LLM runs, and GPU compose overlay improvements for out-of-the-box backend switching.
- **Model lifecycle UX**: Expanded model catalog metadata, clearer rebuild requirements, and improved model switching + status reflection (including Kroko embedded inference and Kokoro settings alignment).

### Fixed

- **Local provider audio + barge-in stability**: Robust barge-in protocol handling, improved gating to avoid STT/TTS talk-loops, and stabilized timing/latency tracking for local calls.
- **Tool-call parsing robustness**: Hardened local tool-call extraction against malformed wrappers/markdown/control-token leaks; improved clean-text extraction to prevent tool syntax from reaching TTS.
- **Hangup correctness**: Added/strengthened hangup guardrails for local LLMs to prevent hallucinated end-call tool executions; improved farewell handling to avoid spoken tool chatter.
- **MeloTTS reliability**: Fixed build/runtime pinning, warmup behavior, and upstream install regressions to restore stable container rebuilds.
- **AAVA-200 — Cosmetic UI bug at end of local full setup**: Fixed "No such container" error displayed at completion of the local AI setup wizard flow.
- **AAVA-199 — Transfer tool enabling error on fresh install**: Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null` when enabling the transfer tool on a fresh installation.
- **AAVA-193 — Setup Wizard local_ai_server start/logs fails**: Fixed compose execution context issue where the wizard's start and log-streaming commands failed due to incorrect working directory.
- **AAVA-195 — Kroko embedded selection when binary unavailable**: Admin UI now gates Kroko embedded mode behind capability detection across Wizard, Env page, and model selectors; added rebuild hints for all optional backends (Faster-Whisper, Whisper.cpp, MeloTTS) and added missing Whisper.cpp backend to Env page STT dropdown.

### Refactored

- **Local AI Server internals**: Consolidated and hardened model loading, status reporting, and model switching paths with degraded-start behavior and operator-visible fallbacks.

### Guardrails

- **Structured local tool gateway**: Allowlist-driven tool execution path with repair/structured-decision fallbacks; explicit blocking of unsafe terminal tools without user intent (especially `hangup_call`).

### Performance

- **LLM startup tuning**: Improved default context sizing on GPU, optional auto-context selection/caching, and startup warmup/latency instrumentation for operator visibility.

### Security

- **Concurrent rebuild race condition**: Fixed TOCTOU race on `_active_rebuild` flag — atomic check-and-set under lock prevents duplicate Docker builds.
- **Safe archive extraction**: Zip and tar `extractall` calls now pass validated member lists to prevent path traversal via crafted archives (zip-slip).
- **GGUF magic-byte validation**: Downloaded `.gguf` model files are validated for the `GGUF` magic header before being accepted; corrupt or non-GGUF files are cleaned up automatically.
- **Active-call guard on model switch**: `/api/local-ai/switch` blocks model switches while AI Engine reports active calls (override via `force_incompatible_apply`); unreachable engine treated as blocked.
- **Path traversal hardening**: All model download paths, voice file names, and custom LLM model paths are sanitized via `_safe_filename` and `_safe_join_under_dir` helpers; strict filename validation rejects directory traversal patterns.

### Docs

- **Local AI onboarding docs refresh**: Updated installation + local-only setup guides, hardware requirements, local profiles, and CLI tools guide; added archived GPU learnings + audit report for GA readiness tracking.

## [6.2.2] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Vertex AI Credentials Not Found**: Auto-inject `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env var when the service account JSON file exists at the default mount path (`/app/project/secrets/gcp-service-account.json`). Handles 3 cases: env var unset, env var pointing to missing file (override), and stale pointer with no fallback (unset to prevent ADC crash).
- **Vertex AI ADC Graceful Fallback**: When `use_vertex_ai: true` but ADC fails (e.g. no service account uploaded), the Google Live provider now falls back to Developer API (api_key) mode instead of crashing the call with `DefaultCredentialsError`. Consistent `_vertex_active` instance flag ensures model path, tool responses, and connection URL all use the correct API format after fallback.
- **Secrets Directory Permissions**: `setup_secrets_directory()` in `install.sh` now always fixes ownership to UID 1000 (appuser) with mode 2770, not just on creation. Fixes "Permission denied" when uploading Vertex AI credentials via Admin UI (backend runs as appuser via gosu).
- **False "Apply Changes" for local_ai_server** (AAVA-192 related): Environment page no longer shows restart prompts for containers that aren't running — prevents confusing drift detection when `local_ai_server` is intentionally stopped.
- **AAVA-192 — install.sh Duplicate YAML Keys**: Fallback path in `update_yaml_llm()` no longer blindly appends a duplicate `llm:` block. Uses Python/PyYAML or sed-based in-place update when the block already exists.
- **AAVA-185 — Dashboard Pipeline Variant Display**: Wizard now sets `active_pipeline` and `default_provider` to the variant-specific name (e.g. `local_hybrid_groq`) when Groq LLM is selected. Dashboard topology adds defensive variant matching for backward compatibility.

### Added

- **Secrets Directory in install.sh**: `setup_secrets_directory()` creates `./secrets/` with correct permissions (2770) during installation, aligning with `preflight.sh`.
- **COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME Auto-set**: `install.sh` now ensures `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=asterisk-ai-voice-agent` is set in `.env` for consistency with `preflight.sh`.
- **Auto-upsert GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS on Upload**: When Vertex AI credentials are uploaded via Admin UI, the env var is automatically added to `.env` for persistence across container recreates.

### Migration from v6.2.1

1. **No breaking changes.** All fixes are backward compatible.
2. **Vertex AI users**: Credentials will be auto-detected on next container restart — no manual `.env` editing needed.
3. **Docker rebuild required**: Run `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` to pick up all fixes.

## [6.2.1] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Google Vertex AI Live API Support**: Enterprise-grade authentication for Google Live API using GCP service accounts. Switch between Developer API (API key) and Vertex AI (OAuth2) modes via Admin UI toggle. Includes credential upload/verify/delete endpoints, environment injection, and preflight secrets directory validation ([PR #235](https://github.com/hkjarral/Asterisk-AI-Voice-Agent/pull/235)).
- **Admin UI Vertex AI Configuration**: New Vertex AI section in Google Live provider settings with project/location selectors, credential upload widget, and real-time verification status.
- **Preflight Secrets Directory Check**: `preflight.sh` now validates and auto-creates `./secrets/` with correct ownership and permissions (2770) for service account JSON files.
- **Golden Baseline Config**: `config/ai-agent.golden-google-live.yaml` updated with Vertex AI configuration examples.

### Changed

- **Google Live Provider**: Dual-mode endpoint construction — Vertex AI uses `{location}-aiplatform.googleapis.com` with OAuth2 bearer tokens; Developer API unchanged.
- **Tool Response Format**: Removed `id` field from `functionResponses` when using Vertex AI (not supported by Vertex API).

### Fixed

- **Async Blocking Call**: `credentials.refresh()` now runs in thread pool to avoid blocking asyncio event loop.
- **Exception Leaking**: Vertex AI endpoints no longer expose internal error details to clients.
- **Null Filename Check**: `upload_vertex_credentials` validates `file.filename` before use.

### Documentation

- Milestone 25: Google Vertex AI Live API Support (`docs/contributing/milestones/milestone-25-google-vertex.md`)

### Migration from v6.2.0

1. **No breaking changes.** Vertex AI is opt-in; existing API key mode works unchanged.
2. **Vertex AI users**: Upload service account JSON via Admin UI → Google Live → Vertex AI Configuration.
3. **Docker rebuild required**: Run `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` for secrets volume mount.

## [6.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **NumPy Audio Resampler**: Replaced legacy `audioop.ratecv` with NumPy linear interpolation at all 19 call sites, eliminating audio crackling artifacts. Community contribution by [@turgutguvercin](https://github.com/turgutguvercin) ([PR #204](https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk/pull/204)).
- **Google Native Audio Latest Model**: Support for `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-latest` — Google's audio-native model with true audio understanding, tuned defaults for telephony use cases.

- **Telnyx AI Inference LLM**: New modular pipeline provider `telnyx_llm` using OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions via Telnyx AI Inference. Access 53+ models (GPT-4o, Claude, Llama, Mistral) with a single `TELNYX_API_KEY`. Includes golden baseline config, Admin UI provider form, and setup guide. Community contribution by Abhishek @ Telnyx ([PR #219](https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk/pull/219)).
- **Preflight `--force`**: Bypass unsupported OS check for exotic distributions.

### Changed

- **Google Live Farewell Handling**: Settled on farewell-play-out design (removed experimental auto-reconnect on 1008 disconnect); neutralized tool response to prevent duplicate farewells.
- **Google Live TTS Gating**: Per-segment re-arm so silence replaces echo on every turn; enabled on AudioSocket transport.
- **Call Ending Prompts**: Tightened prompts to prevent verbal farewell before `hangup_call` tool invocation across all providers.
- **Transparent Model Name Flow**: Removed silent fallback/remapping for Google Live model names; aligned names across UI and wizard.
- **Demo Contexts Restored**: All 11 demo contexts from v6.0.0 baseline restored.

### Fixed

- **Audio Crackling**: NumPy resampler fixes crackling caused by `audioop.ratecv` discontinuities ([PR #204](https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk/pull/204), [@turgutguvercin](https://github.com/turgutguvercin)).
- **Call Termination Hardening**: 13 fixes across providers, engine, and AudioSocket for reliable call endings and proper cleanup.
- **Google Live Duplicate Farewell**: 6+ iterations eliminating race conditions between tool-ack `turnComplete`, forced farewell, and model post-hangup speech.
- **Google Live Premature Hangup**: Fixed hangup firing on tool-acknowledgment `turnComplete` before farewell audio finishes playing.
- **Google Live Model Names**: Transparent model name flow — removed silent fallback/remapping; aligned names across UI and wizard.
- **Pipeline Call History**: Tool calls now recorded in session so they appear in Admin UI Call History.
- **Provider Topology Accuracy**: Clear stale `provider_name` on pipeline calls so UI topology is accurate.
- **Agent CLI Conflict Markers**: Reduced conflict-marker false positives in `agent check`.
- **Agent CLI Wizard Logger**: Removed invalid logger kwargs.
- **Agent CLI Restore Safety**: Hardened `check --fix` restore to avoid partial writes.
- **Admin UI Tool Catalog**: Removed unreachable except in tool catalog (PR #212).

### Security

- **CodeQL SSRF Fix**: Google API key now passed as params instead of URL path to prevent SSRF (CodeQL alert).

### Documentation

- Telnyx AI Inference Provider Setup Guide (`docs/Provider-Telnyx-Setup.md`)
- Milestones 23 (NAT) and 24 (Phase Tools) added to milestone history
- Complete documentation, roadmap, and community alignment overhaul
- Roadmap and Milestone History links added to main README hero nav bar

### Migration from v6.1.1

1. **No breaking changes.** All new features are additive or opt-in.
2. Existing `config/ai-agent.yaml` continues to work unchanged.
3. **Docker rebuild required**: Run `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` for all containers.
4. **Telnyx users**: Add `TELNYX_API_KEY` to `.env` and configure `telnyx_hybrid` pipeline. See `docs/Provider-Telnyx-Setup.md`.
5. **Google Live users**: Default model updated to `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-latest`. No action needed unless you pinned a specific model.

## [6.1.1] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Operator Config Override (`ai-agent.local.yaml`)**: Operator customizations are now stored in `config/ai-agent.local.yaml` (git-ignored), deep-merged on top of the base `config/ai-agent.yaml` at startup. All Admin UI saves, CLI wizard writes, and `agent setup` output target the local file, so upstream `git pull` never conflicts with operator config. Local overrides can delete base keys by setting them to `null`.
- **Graceful Stash Pop Recovery**: `agent update` now automatically recovers from `git stash pop` merge conflicts by resetting the working tree, dropping the failed stash, and restoring operator config (`.env`, `ai-agent.yaml`, `ai-agent.local.yaml`, `users.json`, `contexts/`) from the pre-update backup.
- **Live Agent Transfer Tool**: Explicit `live_agent_transfer` tool with ARI-based extension status checks, auto-derived internal extension keys, and fallback routing to configured live-agent destinations.
- **ARI Extension Status API**: Admin UI endpoint to query Asterisk device/endpoint state for live agent availability before transferring.
- **ViciDial Outbound Dialer Compatibility**: Configurable `AAVA_OUTBOUND_DIAL_CONTEXT`, `AAVA_OUTBOUND_DIAL_PREFIX`, `AAVA_OUTBOUND_CHANNEL_TECH`, and `AAVA_OUTBOUND_PBX_TYPE` (`freepbx`/`vicidial`/`generic`) for outbound campaign origination.
- **GPU Host/Runtime Indicators**: Runtime GPU probe details in local AI server status with CUDA guard for STT/TTS backend selection and CPU fallback when GPU is unavailable.
- **GPU-Aware Compatibility Checks**: Force rebuild flow for incompatible runtime/device combinations with `force_incompatible_apply` flag for intentional overrides.
- **Local-Hybrid Wizard Persistence**: Setup wizard correctly persists `local_hybrid` pipeline, local STT/TTS backend selections, and model mappings through env and YAML config.
- **Asterisk Config Discovery (Admin UI)**: New **System → Asterisk** page with live ARI connection status, required module checklist, configuration audit from preflight, and guided fix snippets. Dashboard pill shows Asterisk connection state (green/red) with click-through. Supports both local and remote Asterisk deployments.
- **Preflight Asterisk Config Audit**: `preflight.sh` now audits `ari.conf`, `http.conf`, `extensions_custom.conf`, and 4 key Asterisk modules (`app_audiosocket`, `res_ari`, `res_stasis`, `chan_pjsip`), writing results to `data/asterisk_status.json` for the Admin UI.

### Changed

- **Tool Name Canonicalization**: `transfer` is now an alias for `blind_transfer`. `live_agent` and `transfer_to_live_agent` are aliases for `live_agent_transfer`. Tool allowlisting uses `canonicalize_tool_name()` for alias-aware matching across contexts.
- **Admin UI Live Agent Section**: Status pills with real-time ARI checks, rebalanced row columns, destination override hidden behind Advanced toggle, internal extensions labeled as live agents.
- **Admin UI Docker Compose GPU Overlay**: `start`/`recreate`/`rebuild` actions for `local_ai_server` now include `docker-compose.gpu.yml` when `GPU_AVAILABLE=true`.

### Fixed

- **`blind_transfer` Destination Resolution**: Fixed numeric target resolution and cross-provider naming (`transfer` vs `blind_transfer`) in tool allowlists.
- **`live_agent_transfer` Fallback Routing**: Prevents mapping to non-live-agent destinations; falls back to explicit live-agent config or internal extensions.
- **Streaming `provider_grace_ms` Cap**: Reverted then re-fixed the 60ms hardcoded cap on `provider_grace_ms` that degraded streaming latency.
- **`check_extension_status` Opt-In**: Made the extension status tool opt-in; removed hardcoded transfer key examples from tool registry.
- **Admin UI Log Troubleshooting**: Exclude per-frame audio noise from log views; add milestone tracking markers.
- **Admin UI System API Indentation**: Fixed YAML indentation in system config API responses.
- **Environment Drift Detection**: Ignore compose-injected `HEALTH_BIND_HOST` (only track `HEALTH_CHECK_*` prefix) to prevent perpetual "pending restart" drift in Env UI.
- **Docker Image Metadata**: Handle missing Docker image metadata in containers API (`ImageNotFound` after prune/rebuild) without failing the endpoint.
- **GPU Compose Overlay Preservation**: Preserve GPU compose overlay for `local_ai_server` UI actions (start, recreate, rebuild) so GPU device requests are not silently dropped.
- **EnvPage GPU-Aware CUDA Options**: CUDA device option for Faster-Whisper and MeloTTS only shown when `GPU_AVAILABLE=true`.

### Documentation

- ViciDial Integration Guide (`docs/Vicidial-Setup.md`)
- Fixed `transfer_call` references to canonical `transfer` / `blind_transfer` in ElevenLabs milestone docs
- Updated 9 docs for `ai-agent.local.yaml` config override system and stash pop recovery procedures

### Migration from v6.0.0

1. **No breaking changes.** All new features are additive or opt-in.
2. Existing `config/ai-agent.yaml` continues to work unchanged. The new `ai-agent.local.yaml` is optional.
3. **Docker rebuild required**: Run `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` for all containers.
4. **ViciDial users**: Set `AAVA_OUTBOUND_PBX_TYPE=vicidial` in `.env` and configure dial context/prefix as needed.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-02-07

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **OpenAI Realtime API version default changed to GA**: The default `api_version` is now `ga` (was `beta`). GA uses a nested audio schema (`audio.input.format` / `audio.output.format` with MIME types) instead of flat fields. Set `api_version: beta` explicitly to keep the old behavior.
- **Email template autoescaping enabled**: `template_renderer.py` now uses `autoescape=True` by default. Custom HTML templates that rely on unescaped variable output may need to use Jinja2's `| safe` filter for intentionally raw HTML variables.

### Added

- **OpenAI Realtime GA API Support**: Full Beta-to-GA migration with `api_version` toggle (`ga` / `beta`). GA mode uses nested `audio.input.format` / `audio.output.format` with MIME types (`audio/pcm`, `audio/pcmu`, `audio/pcma`), `turn_detection` under `audio.input`, and `output_modalities` instead of `modalities`. Production-validated with `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17`.
- **OpenAI Realtime `project_id`**: New config field and UI input for OpenAI project tracking via the `OpenAI-Project` header.
- **OpenAI Realtime Voice Expansion**: 10 voices with gender labels (alloy, ash, ballad, cedar, coral, echo, marin, sage, shimmer, verse). Removed unsupported voices (nova, fable, onyx).
- **Email System Overhaul**: New SMTP client (`smtp_client.py`) with rate limiting and deduplication, email dispatcher with provider abstraction (Resend / SMTP / auto-detect), HTML template engine with Jinja2 sandboxed rendering, per-context `from_email` / `admin_email` overrides, subject prefix, `call_outcome` and `hangup_initiator` template variables.
- **Email Template Editor**: Admin UI modal for editing HTML email templates with defaults, preview, and per-tool configuration.
- **SMTP Test Email**: Admin UI button to send a test email using current SMTP settings before saving.
- **Google Live Hangup Fallback Watchdog**: Tunable timeout-based fallback for calls where Google Live does not emit `turnComplete`. Four new config fields: `hangup_fallback_audio_idle_sec`, `hangup_fallback_min_armed_sec`, `hangup_fallback_no_audio_timeout_sec`, `hangup_fallback_turn_complete_timeout_sec`.
- **Google Live `toolConfig`**: Explicit tool configuration in setup message; fixed empty `required` arrays that caused 1008 disconnects.
- **NAT / Advertise Host (Milestone 23)**: `AUDIOSOCKET_ADVERTISE_HOST` and `EXTERNAL_MEDIA_ADVERTISE_HOST` environment variables for split-horizon / NAT deployments where the advertised address differs from the bind address.
- **GPU Acceleration Path**: `docker-compose.gpu.yml` overlay, `Dockerfile.gpu` with CUDA wheel build for llama-cpp-python, preflight GPU detection (`GPU_AVAILABLE` env var), and gated GPU layer configuration.
- **Dashboard Live System Topology**: Clickable topology nodes navigate to settings pages (Providers → `/providers`, Pipelines → `/pipelines`, Models → `/models`, Asterisk/AI Engine → `/env`). Active model cards, pipeline path highlighting, platform info bar, compact resource strip.
- **Admin UI Modernization**: Modern confirm dialogs (replaced all `alert()` / `confirm()`), toast notifications, `AlertDialog` component, SVG T-junction arrows, hover transitions, loading spinners.
- **EnvPage Refactor**: Tab-based UI (AI Engine / Local AI / System) with comprehensive variable coverage, Docker Build Settings section for `INCLUDE_*` build-time flags.
- **Help Section**: In-app documentation viewer with terminal-style rendering.
- **Models Page Redesign**: Stacked full-width layout with active model cards showing real-time usage during calls.
- **Env Drift Detection**: "Apply Changes" now detects `.env` drift vs running containers and recomputes the apply plan. SMTP/Resend env changes correctly trigger `ai_engine` restart.

### Changed

- **Hangup Tool Simplified (v5.0 design)**: Removed transcript-offer guardrails from `hangup_call` tool. The AI now manages transcript offers via system prompt instead of tool-level blocking. Simpler, fewer race conditions.
- **UI `downstream_mode` options**: Replaced invalid `burst` option with valid `file` option to match backend schema.
- **UI `response_modalities` serialization**: Now serializes as `List[str]` (e.g., `["audio"]`) instead of a comma-separated string.

### Fixed

- **Google Live Hangup Before `turnComplete`**: Fixed race where hangup could fire before the provider emitted `turnComplete`, causing stuck calls.
- **Google Live Model Normalization**: Hardened model name normalization and provider options to prevent 1008 errors from malformed setup messages.
- **OpenAI Realtime GA Schema Stabilization**: 15+ iterative fixes for GA session.update format — MIME types, nested format objects, rate fields, turn_detection placement, delta type handling, output format enforcement.
- **OpenAI Realtime GA `response.create`**: Removed `output_modalities` and `input` array from GA response.create (rejected by API).
- **OpenAI Realtime GA `delta` Handling**: Fixed crash where `response.output_audio.delta` sends `delta` as a base64 string, not a dict.
- **Email Template Save**: Fixed template persistence and `call_outcome` variable availability.
- **Request Transcript Email**: Fixed issue where `request_transcript` used the last email address instead of the one from the current request.
- **UI No-Op Knobs Removed**: Removed `create_response` checkbox from OpenAI Realtime form (GA hardcodes `true`), removed `continuous_input` checkbox from Google Live form (no backend field).
- **Test Alignment**: OpenAI Realtime provider test updated for GA payload shape; hangup tool tests aligned with v5.0 simplified design.

### Security

- **Email Template Autoescaping**: `SandboxedEnvironment(autoescape=True)` prevents HTML injection from user-controlled template variables (e.g., caller speech transcripts). Pre-escaped keys (`transcript_html`, `transcript`) use `Markup()` to avoid double-escaping.

### Migration from v5.3.1

1. **OpenAI Realtime users**: If you were using the default `api_version` (previously `beta`), the new default is `ga`. To keep beta behavior, explicitly set `providers.openai_realtime.api_version: beta` in your YAML config.
2. **Email users**: SMTP support is new. Existing Resend-only setups continue to work unchanged. To use SMTP, add `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` to your `.env`.
3. **Docker rebuild required**: Run `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` for all containers.
4. **Run preflight**: Execute `./preflight.sh` to detect GPU availability and validate system state.

## [5.3.1] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Deepgram Language Configuration**: Voice Agent language is now configurable via Admin UI and YAML (`agent_language` field). Supports 30+ languages including English variants, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, and more.
- **Phase Tools (Milestone 24)**: Pre-call HTTP lookups (enrichment), in-call HTTP tools (AI-invoked during conversation), and post-call webhooks (fire-and-forget automation).
- **HTTP Tool Debug Trace Logs**: When `LOG_LEVEL=debug`, pre/in/post-call HTTP tools emit `[HTTP_TOOL_TRACE]` logs showing the resolved request (URL/headers/body), referenced variables, and a bounded response preview to speed up troubleshooting.
- **Extension Availability Tool (AAVA-53)**: New `check_extension_status` tool to query Asterisk device state (e.g., `PJSIP/2765`) so the AI can decide whether to transfer or continue.
- **Hangup Policy Controls**: `hangup_call` now supports a configurable policy (markers and guardrails) via `tools.hangup_call.policy`.
- **Admin UI YAML Error Recovery**: YAML parse errors now show a banner with line/column and the Raw YAML page can still load content for quick fixes.
- **Agent CLI RCA Enhancements**: `agent rca [call_id]` support, optional `--llm` forcing, and tool call extraction to improve post-call debugging.

### Fixed

- **RTP Greeting Cutoff on External Trunk Calls**: Fixed issue where greeting audio was cut off on calls from external trunks. Root cause: Asterisk ExternalMedia requires audio to flow through the mixing bridge before it sends RTP. Added "RTP kick" that plays brief silence through the bridge immediately after ExternalMedia setup, triggering RTP flow in ~40-50ms instead of waiting 5-7 seconds for caller audio.
- **Admin UI Setup Wizard (AAVA-164)**: ElevenLabs Agent ID field now auto-populates from `.env` file when re-running the wizard.
- **Admin UI Log Export (AAVA-162)**: Exported debug logs now redact email addresses (`[EMAIL_REDACTED]`) to protect user privacy.
- **Admin UI Environment Changes (AAVA-161)**: "Apply Changes" after modifying `.env` variables now uses `docker compose --force-recreate` instead of container restart, ensuring environment variable changes are actually applied (e.g., `LOG_TO_FILE`, `LOG_FILE_PATH`).
- **In-Call HTTP Tools Config Wiring**: Align tool schema across engine/Admin UI/docs and support context allowlisting of in-call HTTP tools.
- **Admin UI Variable Usability Hint**: HTTP tool editors now highlight variable names that can be referenced elsewhere (e.g., `{patient_id}`), reducing confusion with JSON extraction paths (e.g., `patient.id`).
- **Google Live Transcription Stability**: Reduce duplicate transcript fragments and improve output PCM rate detection from provider mimeType.

### Security

- Admin UI HTTP tool **Test** now blocks localhost/private targets by default (SSRF mitigation); can be overridden for trusted networks via environment variables.

## [5.2.5] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- Updates: publish the `asterisk-ai-voice-agent-updater` image to GHCR on release tags (aligned with other containers).
- Admin UI: Stable/Main/Advanced update targets + render the latest release notes (from `CHANGELOG.md`) after **Check updates**.
- Agent CLI: `agent update` supports semver tag refs like `v5.2.5` (in addition to branches).

### Changed

- Config: fresh installs now default to **AudioSocket** (`audio_transport: audiosocket`).

### Fixed

- Admin UI Updates: prefer pulling the published updater image and fall back to a local build using host networking in restricted DNS/egress environments.

## [5.2.4] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Admin UI: Dashboard no longer performs update checks that can trigger building the updater image; updates are checked only from **System → Updates** on explicit user action.
- Admin UI: Docker Services “Restart” uses Docker SDK restart (avoids compose recreate failures on hosts where repo paths like `/root/...` are not accessible inside the `admin_ui` container).
- Admin UI: compose-based start/recreate/build operations are executed via the detached updater runner to ensure host-path resolution is correct.

## [5.2.3] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Agent CLI: `agent update` no longer runs an unscoped `docker compose up` when Compose files change; it targets only running/impacted services to avoid unintentionally creating optional services (e.g., `local_ai_server`) and failing on systems that never built those images.

## [5.2.2] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Agent CLI: `agent update` now fetches branches using an explicit refspec so `origin/<ref>` is reliably updated (prevents false “Already up to date” results when the remote-tracking branch is stale).

## [5.2.1] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- Admin UI: **System → Updates** page with a GitHub-style flow: **Check updates → choose branch → preview file/container impact → proceed**.
- Admin UI: branch dropdown supports updating to **any remote branch** (useful for testing feature/fix branches via UI).
- Admin UI: **Recent Runs** table (last 10) with job summaries (success/failure, rebuild/restart actions, file count) and recovery helpers.
- Admin UI: one-click **Rollback** for failed update jobs (restores pre-update code + operator config from the backup; rebuilds/restarts only impacted services).
- Admin UI: keep full update logs for both success and failure runs.
- Agent CLI: `agent update` enhancements for UI-driven updates:
  - `--plan` / `--plan-json` to preview actions without applying
  - `--checkout` to allow switching branches when updating to a non-current ref
  - `--include-ui` to include/exclude `admin_ui` rebuild/restart
  - `--backup-id` for stable backups (used by UI jobs)
  - UI-driven updates also refresh the project-local CLI binary at `./.agent/bin/agent`

### Changed

- Updates: “latest version” checks consider **`v*` tags only** and compute status using commit ancestry (handles “local ahead” cleanly).
- Updates: UI-triggered jobs write state under `./.agent/updates/jobs/` and backups under `./.agent/update-backups/<job_id>/`.
- Updater: update/plan execution runs in a **detached updater container** so jobs survive `admin_ui` rebuild/restarts.

### Fixed

- Updates: docker compose operations from inside containers now resolve bind mounts correctly by mounting the repo at the **same absolute host path**.
- Updates: respect non-default Docker socket mounts (e.g., `DOCKER_SOCK`) when starting updater jobs.
- Updates: avoid transient “Update job not found” UI errors immediately after starting a job.

## [5.1.7] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- Engine: provider-agnostic **Upstream Squelch** for continuous-audio providers with native VAD (improves end-of-turn detection in noisy environments).
- Admin UI: new **Upstream Squelch** controls and tooltips under Advanced → VAD.
- Streaming (ExternalMedia RTP): add a short, configurable wait for the remote RTP endpoint during the initial greeting before falling back to file playback (reduces “dead air until caller speaks” on some Asterisk setups).

### Changed

- Config: default `farewell_hangup_delay_sec` is now `5` seconds (provider override still wins when set).
- Prompts: updated OpenAI Realtime demo greeting text.

### Fixed

- Admin UI: auto-detect the media directory group inside the container and add `appuser` to that GID at startup, preventing false “media directory not writable” warnings after host reboots on systems where Asterisk uses a non-default group ID.
- Hangup tool: provider-agnostic transcript gating and contact-confirmation guardrails to prevent premature hangups and repeated transcript prompts.
- OpenAI Realtime: avoid cutting off farewell speech by waiting for `output_audio.done` before emitting `HangupReady`.

## [5.1.6] - 2026-01-20

### Added

- Admin UI Dashboard: show current project version in the **System Ready** card (best-effort detection via `git describe` with fallback to README parsing; supports `AAVA_PROJECT_VERSION` override).

### Changed

- Docs/CLI: align operator-facing version references to `v5.1.6` (avoid hardcoded `v5.0` strings in CLI help/output where possible).
- Agent CLI: default `agent version` string now reports `5.1.6` (still overridable via `-ldflags`).

### Fixed

- Admin UI Setup Wizard: OpenAI Realtime now prompts for the OpenAI API key (no Groq key mix-up) and validates correctly.
- Agent CLI `agent rca`: detect AudioSocket vs ExternalMedia calls and tailor transport diagnostics (avoid AudioSocket-only false positives).
- Admin UI System Ready: report **host** Docker Compose version via container labels (`com.docker.compose.version`) with fallback to container CLI detection when labels aren’t available.
- Admin UI Web Terminal: input text is now legible on dark background (light text).
- Docker builds: pin base OS/runtime to avoid upstream tag drift (`admin_ui`/`ai_engine`: Debian 12 `bookworm` + Python 3.11; `local_ai_server`: Debian 13 `trixie` + Python 3.11 for Kroko compatibility).
- Ollama pipelines: prevent overly-eager `hangup_call` tool calls from ending calls when the caller did not indicate end-of-call intent; support `num_ctx` pass-through and honor `tools_enabled` for tool calling.
- Email transcripts: improve Outlook compatibility by rendering transcript newlines as `<br/>` (HTML-escaped) so caller/AI lines display correctly across clients.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed

- **CLI Command Names**: v5.0.0 binaries were built with old command names; this release includes the updated CLI:
  - `agent check` - Standard diagnostics report (renamed from `agent doctor`)
  - `agent rca` - Post-call root cause analysis (renamed from `agent troubleshoot`)
  - `agent setup` - Interactive setup wizard (renamed from `agent init`)
  - Legacy aliases (`doctor`, `troubleshoot`, `init`, `demo`) remain available as hidden commands for backward compatibility

- **Preflight Script - Remote Asterisk Support** (AAVA-150):
  - New `check_data_permissions()` function runs regardless of Asterisk location
  - Fixes `call_history.db` read-only error for users with remote/containerized Asterisk
  - Detects and fixes root-owned database files that container user cannot write to

- **Preflight Script - Symlink Handling** (AAVA-150):
  - Non-empty directories at `/var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ai-generated` now auto-backed up with `--apply-fixes`
  - Fixes the "ai-generated/ai-generated/" double-path issue
  - Prevents silent symlink creation failures

  - Campaign scheduler (single-node) with pacing + concurrency controls
  - CSV lead import (skip-existing), lead actions (recycle/reset/ignore/delete)
  - Dialplan-assisted voicemail detection via Asterisk `AMD()` and voicemail drop
  - Optional consent gate (DTMF `1` accept / `2` deny / timeout tracking)
  - Recording library (upload once, reuse across campaigns) + shipped default consent/voicemail prompts
- Groq Speech (STT + TTS) adapters for modular pipeline deployments
- Attended (warm) transfer tool with DTMF acceptance flow
- Preflight hardening and operator guidance (cross-platform checks, docker socket guidance, local-ai “minimal vs full” mode)

### Changed

- Standardized Docker Compose service/container names: `admin_ui`, `ai_engine`, `local_ai_server`
- Container base OS alignment:
  - `admin_ui`: Python 3.11 on Debian 12 (`bookworm`)
  - `ai_engine`: Python 3.11 on Debian 12 (`bookworm`)
  - `local_ai_server`: Python 3.11 on Debian 13 (`trixie`) (intentional for embedded Kroko/glibc compatibility)

### Fixed

- Outbound dialer reliability fixes (caller-id inheritance, outcome tracking, SQLite write/lock edge cases, duplicate side-effects)
- Admin UI stability improvements (tooltips, recording preview UX, safer compose/health behaviors)
- Ollama pipeline robustness (provider config resolution + tool-result handling improvements)

### Docs

- Added `docs/OUTBOUND_CALLING.md` and updated FreePBX + installation docs for v5.0.0

## [4.6.0] - 2025-12-29

  - `ASTERISK_ARI_SCHEME` (`http|https`) with `ws://` vs `wss://` alignment
  - `ASTERISK_ARI_SSL_VERIFY` toggle for self-signed or hostname mismatch environments
- Pipeline robustness: invalid pipelines are detected and fall back deterministically instead of silently using placeholder adapters
- Admin UI logging improvements: structured event support and improved Logs viewing UX

### Changed

- Admin UI config management: safer `.env` parsing/writes and clearer apply guidance (“save vs apply” determinism)
- Admin UI health checks: Tier 3/best-effort probe fallbacks with explicit warnings when configured overrides are unreachable
- Admin UI container actions: safer `admin_ui` restart behavior from within the UI
- Compose env semantics: `.env` is authoritative; avoid `${VAR:-default}` fallbacks in compose that prevent UI env changes from taking effect

### Fixed

- Preflight: Debian-family best-effort detection improvements and Debian 12 Docker repo codename fallback (`bookworm`) when `VERSION_CODENAME` is missing
- Admin UI Docker management hardening: restrict compose operations to AAVA services and reduce information exposure in error messages

### Docs

- Upgrade guidance: `v4.6.0 → v5.0.0` checklist in `docs/INSTALLATION.md`
- IPv6 policy: warn/recommend disabling IPv6 for GA stability and document mitigation steps

- Tests for RTP routing/security and Prometheus label cardinality
- Admin UI backend: model switching mappings for `faster_whisper` STT and `melotts` TTS

### Changed

- Default provider now `local_hybrid` (pipeline-first GA default)
- Readiness probe is pipeline-aware when `default_provider` references a pipeline (e.g., `local_hybrid`)
- Prometheus metrics are low-cardinality only (removed per-call labels like `call_id`; per-call detail lives in Call History)

### Fixed

- ExternalMedia RTP SSRC routing: prevent cross-call audio mixing by using authoritative `call_id` in engine callback
- Admin UI HealthWidget rebuild payload: stop mis-parsing model/voice identifiers
- Local provider readiness badge: report “configured” vs “connected” semantics correctly

### Removed

- Legacy bundled Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack and `monitoring/` assets from the main repo path (Call History-first debugging; bring-your-own monitoring)

### Improved (Onboarding & DX)

- Preflight is now **required** (not recommended) in all documentation
- Admin UI Dockerfile default bind aligned to `0.0.0.0` (matches docker-compose.yml for out-of-box accessibility)

- **Cleaner Restarts**: Uses `container.restart()` via Docker SDK instead of destructive stop/rm/up flow
- **Fallback Support**: Gracefully falls back to docker-compose if Docker SDK fails

#### Config File Safety (A8, A11, A12)

- **Atomic Writes**: Config and .env files written via temp file + atomic rename (prevents corruption on crash)
- **Backup Rotation**: Only keeps last 5 backups per file (prevents disk exhaustion)
- **Env Validation**: Rejects empty keys, newlines in values, and `=` in keys before writing .env

### Added - Stability Improvements 🛡️

#### Enhanced Timer Logging (L2)

- **Structured Timer Logs**: All timer operations now log with `[TIMER]` prefix for easy filtering
- **Timer Lifecycle Tracking**: Logs show scheduled, executed, and cancelled timer events
- **Pending Timer Count**: `get_pending_timer_count()` method exposes timer queue depth

- **Uptime Tracking**: `/health` endpoint now returns `uptime_seconds`
- **Pending Timers**: Health response includes `pending_timers` count
- **Active Sessions**: Added `active_sessions` field (alias for `active_calls`)
- **Real Conversation Metrics**: `conversation` object now pulls live data from ConversationCoordinator

#### Graceful Shutdown Handler (M4)

- **SIGTERM Handling**: `docker stop` now waits up to 30 seconds for active calls to complete
- **Shutdown Logging**: `[SHUTDOWN]` prefixed logs track graceful shutdown progress
- **Configurable Timeout**: `engine.stop(graceful_timeout=30)` parameter for custom drain time

### Changed

#### Code Cleanup (H1)

- **Removed Legacy Code**: Deleted commented `active_calls` legacy code block from engine.py
- **SessionStore is Single Source**: All session state now uses SessionStore exclusively

## [4.4.3] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

#### OpenAI Realtime Provider
- **Hangup Tool Reliability**: Fixed issue where calls wouldn't hang up when OpenAI failed to generate farewell audio
  - Now emits `HangupReady` immediately when `response.done` arrives without audio
  - Eliminated reliance on timeout-only fallback mechanism
  - Ensures consistent call termination regardless of OpenAI audio generation
- **Self-Interruption Prevention**: Resolved agent overhearing itself and interrupting mid-response
  - Increased `post_tts_end_protection_ms` from 100ms to 800ms (8x longer guard window)
  - Tuned `turn_detection.threshold` from 0.5 to 0.6 (less sensitive to agent's own voice)
  - Increased `turn_detection.silence_duration_ms` from 600ms to 1000ms (more patient turn-taking)
  - Result: Clean, natural conversation flow without choppy interruptions
- **Greeting Timing**: Attempted optimization of `session.updated` ACK timeout (reverted due to audio issues)

#### Local Hybrid Pipeline
- **Critical Sample Rate Fix**: Resolved Vosk STT recognition failure
  - Changed `external_media.format` from `slin` to `slin16` and `sample_rate` from 8000 to 16000
  - Enabled RTP server resampling to match Vosk's native 16kHz requirement
  - Audio now correctly resampled: 8kHz μ-law → decode → 16kHz PCM16 → Vosk
  - Result: Clear two-way conversation with accurate transcription
- **Audio Flow Debugging**: Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
  - Traces audio bytes, RMS levels, sample counts through full pipeline
  - Helps diagnose future audio routing or quality issues

#### Logging Optimization
- **Production Log Volume**: Reduced local-ai-server log noise
  - Implemented `LOCAL_DEBUG` environment flag to gate verbose audio flow logs
  - Moved detailed audio processing logs (`FEEDING VOSK`, RMS calculation) behind debug flag
  - Preserved essential logs (STT finals, LLM results, TTS output, connection events)
  - Result: ~90% log volume reduction in production with `LOCAL_DEBUG=0`
- **Configuration Clarity**: Improved `.env.example` documentation
  - Clear section headers distinguishing ai-engine vs local-ai-server settings
  - Explicit warnings about log volume impact of debug flags
  - Better guidance on production vs development logging levels

### Added

#### Documentation
- **Local Hybrid Golden Baseline**: Complete production-validated configuration reference

  - Call quality assessment and tuning recommendations
  - See `docs/case-studies/Local-Hybrid-Golden-Baseline.md`
- **Logging Optimization Guide**: Comprehensive logging strategy documentation
  - Debug flag usage, log volume comparison, configuration examples
  - See `docs/LOCAL_AI_SERVER_LOGGING_OPTIMIZATION.md`

#### Unified Transfer Tool (AAVA-63, AAVA-74)
- **Unified Transfer System**: Single `transfer` tool replaces separate `transfer_call` and `transfer_to_queue` tools
  - **Extension Transfers**: Direct dial to specific agents (ARI `redirect`, channel stays in Stasis)
  - **Queue Transfers**: Transfer to ACD queues for next available agent (ARI `continue` to `ext-queues`)
  - **Ring Group Transfers**: Transfer to ring groups that ring multiple agents simultaneously (ARI `continue` to `ext-group`)
- **Smart Routing**: Automatic routing based on destination type configuration
- **Proper Cleanup Handling**: `transfer_active` flag prevents premature caller hangup for queue/ring group transfers
- **Production Verified**: All three transfer types validated on live production server
- **Configuration**: Unified `tools.transfer.destinations` structure with type-based routing

#### Voicemail Tool (AAVA-51)
- **Voicemail Routing**: New `leave_voicemail` tool sends callers to voicemail
  - Routes to FreePBX voicemail via `ext-local,vmu{extension},1` dialplan pattern
  - Uses ARI `continue()` pattern consistent with queue/ring group transfers
  - `transfer_active` flag prevents premature caller hangup
  - Configurable voicemail box extension number
- **Interactive Prompt Strategy**: Tool asks "Are you ready to leave a message now?" to work around FreePBX VoiceMail app behavior
  - VoiceMail app requires bidirectional RTP and voice activity before playing greeting
  - Without caller interaction, 5-8 second delay occurs before greeting plays
  - Caller response establishes RTP path and triggers greeting immediately
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed behavioral analysis and timeline evidence in module docstring
- **Production Verified**: Tested and deployed on live production server

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Removed `transfer_call` and `transfer_to_queue` tools in favor of unified `transfer` tool
- **Configuration Migration**: Update from separate tool configs to unified `transfer.destinations` structure

  - Tracks role (user/assistant), content, and timestamps
  - Enables email tools to include full transcripts
  - Pattern identical across providers (46-51 lines each)

### Improved

#### Warm Transfer Implementation
- **Direct SIP Endpoint Origination**: Eliminates Local channel complexity
  - Previous: Used `Local/{ext}@{context}/n` → caused unidirectional audio
  - Current: Direct SIP origination (e.g., `SIP/6000`)
  - Result: Perfect bidirectional audio confirmed
  - No Local channels created (verified in production)
- **4-Step Cleanup Sequence**:
  1. Remove AI channel from bridge (<50ms)
  2. Stop provider session gracefully (<30ms)
  3. Add agent SIP channel to bridge (<20ms)
  4. Update session metadata (<10ms)
  - Total: <150ms for complete transfer execution
- **Production Validation**:
  - Call duration: 38+ seconds after transfer (stable)
  - Bridge type: simple_bridge (optimal, 2 channels only)
  - Audio path: Direct (1 hop, minimal latency)
  - Files: `src/tools/telephony/transfer.py`, `src/engine.py` (transfer handler)

#### OpenAI Realtime Stability
- **VAD Re-enable Timing Fix**: Correct event for greeting protection
  - Issue: Used `response.audio.done` (fires per segment) → VAD enabled too early
  - Fix: Changed to `response.done` (fires when complete response generated)
  - Impact: Greeting now plays completely before accepting interruptions
  - Lines: `src/providers/openai_realtime.py` (1206-1219)
- **API Modality Constraints**: Documented OpenAI requirements
  - Supported: `["text"]` or `["audio", "text"]`
  - Not supported: `["audio"]` alone (API rejects)
  - Known limitation: May occasionally generate text-only responses
  - Mitigation: System handles gracefully with keepalive messages
- **Race Condition Handling**: Handles variable event arrival order
  - Sometimes: `response.done` arrives before audio deltas
  - Other times: Audio deltas arrive first
  - Solution: Check `had_audio_burst` flag, re-enable VAD regardless

### Fixed

- **AAVA-57**: Direct SIP endpoint origination for warm transfers
  - Root cause: Local channels caused audio direction mismatch
  - Solution: Direct `SIP/extension` origination
  - Evidence: Call logs show no Local channels, perfect audio
- **AAVA-58**: Local channel audio direction issue (RCA documented)
  - Symptom: Caller heard agent, but agent couldn't hear caller
  - Root cause: Audio path `caller → Local;2 → Local;1 → nowhere`
  - Solution: Eliminated Local channels entirely
- **AAVA-59**: AI provider cleanup during transfer
  - Issue: AI stayed in bridge after agent answered
  - Solution: Remove external media channel before adding agent
  - Result: Clean 2-channel bridge (caller + agent only)
- **AAVA-62**: OpenAI Realtime audio generation analysis and constraints
  - Issue #1: Greeting interrupted (VAD enabled too early)
  - Issue #2: 45-second silence (OpenAI generated text-only)
  - Solution: Correct VAD timing + documented API limitation
  - Commits: `85c4235`, `80efdcd`, `6dbd51e`
- **AAVA-52**: Email tools race conditions and missing await
  - Bug #1: `context.get_session()` called without `await`
  - Bug #2: Auto-summary triggered async, session removed first
  - Bug #3: Undefined `caller_id` variable
  - Bug #4: No email confirmation flow
  - Bug #5: Duplicate emails when caller corrected address
  - Commits: `1deed05`, `700993f`, `5579ddd`, `a2d9409`, `835ac05`

  - Frequency: Varies (test call had 2/4 responses without audio)
  - Impact: Caller experiences brief silence
  - Mitigation: System handles gracefully with keepalive messages
  - Not fixable: Cannot force OpenAI to always generate audio
- **Tool Calling**: Currently Deepgram and OpenAI Realtime only
  - Custom Pipeline support planned for v4.3 (AAVA-56)
  - Other providers: Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini (v4.3+)

### Architecture Validation

**Provider-Agnostic Design Confirmed**:
- Same tool code (504 lines for transfer) works with both providers
- Only adapters differ (202 lines Deepgram, 215 lines OpenAI)
- Zero code duplication in tool logic
- Adding new providers requires <250 lines of adapter code

**Line Counts**:
- Tool calling framework: 537 lines (base + context + registry)
- Transfer call tool: 504 lines (shared by all providers)
- Email summary tool: 347 lines (shared)
- Request transcript tool: 475 lines (shared)
- Deepgram adapter: 202 lines
- OpenAI adapter: 215 lines
- **Total duplication**: 0 lines ✅

### Performance Metrics
