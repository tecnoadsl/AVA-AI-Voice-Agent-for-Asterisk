# Roadmap

## Vision

Asterisk AI Voice Agent (AAVA) aims to be the definitive open-source AI voice agent platform for Asterisk/FreePBX. We're building toward a world where any organization can deploy intelligent, natural voice agents on their existing phone infrastructure — with full control over privacy, cost, and provider choice.

## Future Vision

Longer-term goals that will shape the project's direction:

- **WebRTC Browser Client** — SIP client for browser-based calls without a physical phone
- **High Availability / Clustering** — Multi-instance `ai_engine` with session affinity and failover
- **Call Recording** — Consent-managed audio recording with storage backends (playback shipped in v6.3.2)
- **Multi-Language / i18n** — Dynamic language detection and provider switching per call (Russian backends shipped in v6.4.0)
- **Real-Time Dashboard** — Live visualization of active calls with metrics
- **Voice Biometrics** — Voice-based authentication for sensitive operations
- **Streaming Latency <500ms** — Performance optimizations for sub-500ms end-to-end latency
